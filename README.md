# Bacon-Game-Jam-08

My Bacon Jam 08 Game.

**Theme:** *"Millions of them"*  
**Interpritation:** *"Millions of Google Searches"*  
**Title:** *"Google Trends Game"*

## Startup

If you dont have Python you can download it [here](http://www.python.org). The game requires Python.

If you dont have Pygame you can download it [here](http://www.pygame.org). The game also requires pygame. 

When you have downlaoded these two packages, try double clicking `GoogleGame.py`. If this opens the file in a text editor then open your terminal application, such as Terminal, Command Prompt etc. Type the following:

`python Directory/GoogleGame.py`

Where `Directory` is where you saved the file.

## The Game

There are two modes of play, "Trending Now" and "Top of 2013". "Trending Now" downloads the latest trends from [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends), whereas "Top of 2013" uses an offline catagorised database, which is exported from [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends).

When in game you are tasked with selecting the most popular term out of a random two that are presented to you. At the end of the questions (which range from 5 questions to 10 questions) you get a result in the form of a percentage.

## Controls

To play the game select buttons with the mouse, and change catagories with the arrow keys.

## Credits

I'm using my pygame template which can be found [here](https://github.com/HarryBeadle/Pygame-Template/tree/master).

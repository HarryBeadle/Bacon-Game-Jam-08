# Bacon-Game-Jam-08

My Bacon Jam 08 Game.

**Theme:** *"Millions of them"*  
**Interpritation:** *"Millions of Google Searches"*  
**Title:** *"Google Trends Game"*

## The Game

There are two modes of play, "Trending Now" and "Top of 2013". "Trending Now" downloads the latest trends from [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends), whereas "Top of 2013" uses an offline catagorised database, which is exported from [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends).

When in game you are tasked with selecting the most popular term out of a random two that are presented to you. At the end of the questions (which range from 5 questions to 10 questions) you get a result in the form of a percentage.

## Controls

To play the game use the arrow keys and the enter button.

## Credits
